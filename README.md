Slide Out Navigation, a prototype
==========================

This is an iOS implementation of the Slide Out Navigation that many popular applications are using. This project uses ARC (automatic reference counting) and is targeted for iOS 6.x. The views will adjust for both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 aspect ratios.

This code is based upon a design pattern described by Ken Yarmosh (http://kenyarmosh.com//ios-pattern-slide-out-navigation/).
